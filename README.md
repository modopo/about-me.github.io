# Lab - 2

This is a lab to practice conditional statement for inputs. This page utilizes a eventListener to start the quiz once the button is clicked.

An input valdiation function was also implemented to check the user's response.

# Lab - 3

This page was regressed to not include functions, eventListener or button as mentioned in Lab 2. The JS portion was regressed to not have a input validation function, but to check in place during each pass of the game loop for each game (5 questions, guess the number, and pick the answer).

An invalid input would be counted agaisnt the user, purposely failing the attempt.
